# 🏗️ MUST-BUILD SENIOR PROJECTS

## 1. Production SaaS Backend
- Auth
- Subscription
- RBAC
- Queue
- Caching
- File storage

## 2. Microservices System
- API gateway
- Service discovery
- Message broker

## 3. High-scale Realtime System
- WebSocket
- Redis pub/sub

---

# 📚 Daily Learning Routine

## ⏱ 2–4 hours plan
1. 1 hour → theory
2. 2 hours → build
3. 1 hour → read production code

---

# ⭐ Senior Level Checklist

You are senior when you can:

- Design system from scratch
- Debug production performance issues
- Review other developers’ code
- Make architectural decisions
- Deploy scalable apps

# 🎯 Final Advice

❌ Don’t just watch tutorials  
✅ Build large, messy, real-world projects

> “Senior developers are not people who know everything —
they are people who can figure out anything in production.”
